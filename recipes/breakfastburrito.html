    <h3 class="recipeDescription">These air-fried mini burritos are great for a grab 'n go breakfast or even for a midday snack. Leave out the serrano chile pepper for a less spicy version.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredientList">
        <li>¼ cup Mexican-style chorizo</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon bacon grease</li>
        <li>½ cup diced potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 serrano pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>avocado oil cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook chorizo in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until sausage turns a dark red, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
        </li><br>
        <li>Melt bacon grease in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add diced potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion and serrano pepper and continue cooking and stirring until potatoes are fork-tender, onion is translucent, and serrano pepper is soft, 2 to 6 minutes. Add eggs and chorizo; stir until cooked and completely incorporated into potato mixture, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat tortillas in a large skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable. Place 1/3 cup chorizo mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold top and bottom of tortillas over the filling, then roll each into a burrito shape. Mist with cooking spray and place in the basket of an air fryer.</li><br>
        <li>Air fry at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 4 to 6 minutes. Flip each burrito over, mist with cooking spray, and air fry until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes more.</li><br>
    </ol>
